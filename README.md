# Conflict Plan
If disagreements arise during the production of Operation Breach, the following procedures will be followed in order to facilitate effective discourse and reach a commonly agreed upon solution in a timely manner.

An opportunity will be provided for each side to present their respective side to the group as a whole.  This discourse will last 5-10 minutes at which time, the group as a whole will decide, through popular vote, which course of action to persue.  Once the decision has been made there will no longer be further debate and the group will move forward adopting the agreed upon decision.

In the event that the group is split evenly between two possible courses of action, it will be left to the identified team leader to make the final decision.

## Poor Performance
Poor performance by one member will be addressed as a group.  The intent of this intervention will be to highlight and address the issues on hand and more importantly to highlight a way forward that is agreed upon by the majority of group.


## Conflict Escalation
Individuals will be aproached twice by the group for any one issue.  If that individual is disenclined to display any effort to improve the issue will be raised to the next higher level.  In this case it will be the class instructor.
